The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

`Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset, look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of the Olympic Games.`

- In this project using the libraries of python such as NumPy and Pandas, I analyzed the given dataset and found out which country is the King of Olympic games.

- Also Iâ€™ve plotted some bar graphs from the results derived using Matplotlib library of Python.
